1
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:03,646
Kids! Breakfast!

2
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,198
Kids?

3
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:09,383
- Phil, would you get them?
- Yeah. Just a sec.

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:11,125
Kids!

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,513
- That is so...
- Okay.

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,797
Kids?! Get down here!

7
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:21,118
Why are you guys yelling at us
when we're way upstairs?

8
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,512
- Just text me.
- That's not gonna happen.

9
00:00:23,637 --> 00:00:26,729
- And you're not wearing that outfit.
- What's wrong with it?

10
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:29,874
Honey, do you have anything
to say to your daughter about her skirt?

11
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,572
Sorry.
That looks really cute, sweetheart.

12
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:37,536
It's way too short. People know you're
a girl. You don't need to prove it.

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,955
Luke got his head stuck
in the banister again.

14
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,110
I got it.

15
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:44,225
- Where's the baby oil?
- It's in our bedside tab...

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,794
I don't know. Find it.

17
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:48,742
Come on!

18
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:51,919
I was... out of control growing up.

19
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:53,894
There. You know, I said it.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,431
I just don't want my kids
to make the same bad mistakes I made.

21
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,048
If Haley never wakes up
on a beach in Florida half-naked,

22
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,753
I've done my job.

23
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,791
Our job.

24
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,015
Right.

25
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:08,924
I've done our job.

26
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,895
<i>Vamos, Manny! Kick it! Kick it!</i>

27
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,697
Don't let him... Kick it!

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,910
Manny, go.

29
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:21,287
He tripped him, Jay!
Where's the penalty?

30
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,166
Gloria, they're 0-6.
Let's take it down a notch.

31
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,141
We're very different.

32
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:28,949
Jay's from the city.

33
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:31,548
He has a big business.

34
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:33,785
I come from a small village,

35
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,353
very poor but very, very beautiful.

36
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:39,984
It's the number-one village
in all Colombia for all the...

37
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,492
- What's the word?
- Murders.

38
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,356
Yes, the murders.

39
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,376
Manny, stop him!

40
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,719
You can do it!

41
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,529
Damn it, Manny!

42
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,308
Come on, coach!
You got to take that kid out!

43
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:00,327
You want to take him out?
How about I take you out?

44
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:01,719
Honey, honey.

45
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,714
Why don't you worry about your son?

46
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,939
He spend the first half
with his hand in his pants!

47
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,172
I've wanted to tell her off
for the last six weeks.

48
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,342
I'm Josh. Ryan's dad.

49
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,969
Hi. I'm Gloria Pritchett,
Manny's mother.

50
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,435
- And this must be your dad.
- Her dad?

51
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,235
That's funny.
Actually, no, I'm her husband.

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,110
Don't be fooled by the...

53
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,376
Give me a second here.

54
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,721
Who's a good girl?
Who's that?

55
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:33,713
Who's that?

56
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,988
She's adorable!

57
00:02:37,272 --> 00:02:38,407
Hi, precious.

58
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,615
We just adopted her from Vietnam,

59
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,343
and we're bringing her home
for the first time, huh?

60
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:49,291
She's an angel.
You and your wife must be thrilled.

61
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,544
Sorry. Sorry.

62
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,612
Sorry.
Daddy needed snacks.

63
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:56,922
So...

64
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,677
What are we talking about?

65
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:04,022
We have been together for...
God, five... Five years now?

66
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,506
We decided we really wanted
to have a baby.

67
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:11,110
So we had initially asked one of our
lesbian friends to be a surrogate.

68
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:13,254
Then we figured,
they're already mean enough.

69
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,779
Can you imagine one of them pregnant?
No, thank you. Ick.

70
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:18,743
You saw that, right?

71
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:21,016
Everybody fawning over Lily,
and then you walk on,

72
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:25,122
and suddenly it's all, "Oh, Skymall.
I got to buy a motorized tie rack."

73
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,498
- All right, I'm gonna give the speech.
- You are not giving the speech.

74
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,034
We are gonna be stuck with these people
for the next 5 hours.

75
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,692
You're right, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,073
Look at that baby
with those cream puffs.

77
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:38,700
Excuse me, but this baby would have
grown up in a crowded orphanage

78
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:40,635
if it wasn't for us "cream puffs."

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,596
And you know what?
To all of you who judge, hear this.

80
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,891
Love knows no race, creed...

81
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,216
Or gender.
And shame on you...

82
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,318
You small-minded, ignorant few...

83
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:51,243
What?

84
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,304
She's got the cream puffs.

85
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:03,516
We would like to pay
for everyone's headsets.

86
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:19,055
Buddy, why do you keep
getting stuck like this?

87
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,939
I thought I could get out this time.

88
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:22,534
I'm just gonna say it.

89
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:25,159
He needs to be checked
by a specialist.

90
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:28,608
There!
Be free, Excalibur.

91
00:04:29,109 --> 00:04:31,371
- I'm having a friend over today.
- Who?

92
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:33,080
You don't know him.

93
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,459
"Him"? "Him"?

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,950
A boy.
You gonna kiss him?

95
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,335
- Shut up!
- Easy. Easy.

96
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,907
Luke, Alex, why don't you
take it outside, okay?

97
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,396
- And do what?
- Fight in the sun, for a nice change.

98
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,583
- I'm kidding.
- Who's the boy?

99
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,974
His name is Dylan.

100
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,797
I might as well
tell him not to come,

101
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:55,324
because you are just
going to embarrass me again.

102
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,671
Hang on a second. You're 15,

103
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,749
it's the 1st time you've had a boy over.
I'm bound to be a little surprised,

104
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,094
- but I'm not gonna embarrass you.
- I better go charge the camcorder.

105
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:07,597
I'm kidding! Come on!

106
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,307
Who are you talking to?

107
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:11,854
I'm the cool dad. That's my thing.

108
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:15,306
I'm hip. I surf the web. I text.

109
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:17,022
"L.O.L." -- "Laugh out loud."

110
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:18,601
"O.M.G." -- "Oh, my God."

111
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,576
"W.T.F." -- "Why the face?"

112
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,697
I know all the dances
to "High School Musical." So...

113
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:35,625
- Mom! Dad!
- What happened?

114
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:39,045
- Luke just shot me!
- I didn't mean to!

115
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,405
Are you okay?

116
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,548
No! The little bitch shot me!

117
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,134
Language!

118
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:47,345
They're only plastic BBs.
It was an accident.

119
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:51,555
What did I tell you would happen
if you got him a gun? Deal with this.

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,101
Buddy, uncool.

121
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,152
That's it?

122
00:05:57,765 --> 00:06:01,145
The agreement was that if he shoots
someone, you shoot him.

123
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,111
We were serious about that?

124
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,989
We were, and now
you have to follow through.

125
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,700
- I'm so sorry!
- Liar.

126
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:12,079
- Go.
- He's got a birthday party.

127
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,741
What's more important here, Dad?

128
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,762
Shoot him afterwards.
He'll be home at 2:00.

129
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,842
- I can't. I'm showing a house at 2:00.
- What about 3:00?

130
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,022
He's got a soccer game at 3:00,
and then...

131
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,997
We got to leave
for that dinner thing at 5:00.

132
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:27,896
- 4:15. You could shoot him at 4:15.
- I guess that works for me.

133
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,160
"Shoot Luke."

134
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,535
Sorry, dude.
It's on the calendar.

135
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,038
Come on.

136
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,309
I'm quitting soccer.
It is a game for children.

137
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:38,999
You're not quitting.

138
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:42,032
You would have stopped that goal if you
weren't staring at that little girl.

139
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:44,357
She is not a girl. She is a woman.

140
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,181
Gloria, that blow-up with the other mom,
why do you have to do things like that?

141
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:53,616
If somebody says something
about my family...

142
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:56,554
I'm just saying, you could take it
down here a little bit, that's all.

143
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,666
'Cause that's where you live, downhere.
But I live uphere!

144
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,595
You don't have to be so emotional
all the time. That's all I'm saying.

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,058
- Manny, you're with me on this, right?
- I wanna tell Brenda I love her.

146
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:08,414
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- Manny, she's 16.

147
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:10,636
Oh, it's okay for you
to take an older lover?

148
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,671
Watch it!

149
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,878
I want to go
to the mall where she works.

150
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:17,203
But first I need to get
my white shirt, the silk one.

151
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:20,911
- That's what you really want to do?
- Seriously, not to be the evil stepdad,

152
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:24,799
but if you put on a puffy white shirt
and declare your love for a 16-year-old,

153
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,223
you're gonna be swinging from the
flagpole in your puffy white underpants.

154
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,498
Stop the car!

155
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,251
Where are you going?

156
00:07:35,093 --> 00:07:36,840
You see?
You hurt his feelings.

157
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:39,336
Well, if it toughens him up
little bit, then...

158
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,561
Aw, geez.
He's picking flowers.

159
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:45,151
Manny's very passionate,
just like his father.

160
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:49,097
My first husband,
he's very handsome but too crazy.

161
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:51,901
It seemed like all we did
was fight and make love,

162
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,758
fight and make love,
fight and make love.

163
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:56,457
One time, I'm not kidding you,

164
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:58,743
we fell out the window together.

165
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,097
Which one were you doing?

166
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:04,451
I'm hearing this for the first time.

167
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,516
This doesn't worry you?

168
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:10,016
She barely slept on the plane,
and she's still wide awake.

169
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,239
Stop worrying!

170
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,075
Cam, that orphanage was all women.

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,622
Maybe she can't fall asleep
unless she feels a woman's shape.

172
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,197
- I guess that's possible.
- So, here.

173
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:22,993
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

174
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:27,411
I've gained a few extra pounds
while we were expecting the baby,

175
00:08:27,536 --> 00:08:29,254
which has been very difficult.

176
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,383
But, apparently, your body does
a nesting, very maternal, primal thing

177
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,222
<i>where it retains nutrients.</i>

178
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,995
<i>Some sort of
molecular physiology thing.</i>

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,720
<i>But that's science.</i>

180
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,936
<i>You can't... You can't fight it.</i>

181
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,321
So...

182
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,740
- I'm not saying anything.
- You're saying everything.

183
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,050
Count to three.

184
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,350
- Oh, my God. Do you love it?
- Yes. I...

185
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:00,727
What the hell is that?

186
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:02,858
I had André do it
while we were gone.

187
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,259
Is that us... with wings?

188
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,859
We're floating above her.
Always there to protect her.

189
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,263
That's reassuring. Right, Lily? Yes.

190
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,007
We tore you away from everything
you know, but things are normal.

191
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,665
Your fathers are floating fairies.

192
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,354
Can you call André, have him
paint something a little less... gay?

193
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,901
By the way, we need to stop having
friends with names like "André."

194
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,728
Redheaded daddy is angry daddy.

195
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,159
You are. Even Pepper pointed it
out on the way home from the airport.

196
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,069
And that's another one. "Pepper."

197
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,494
Okay, what's up?

198
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,498
All right, look,

199
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,555
I never told my family
we were adopting a baby.

200
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:39,926
- And...
- I know.

201
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:41,751
You do?

202
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:44,332
Yeah, and I don't blame you.
I know your family.

203
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,995
You'd tell them,
they'd say something judgmental.

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,836
- Exactly.
- You'd get mad.

205
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:52,398
Then something supposed to be nothing
but joyful turns into this huge fight.

206
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,878
And who wants a big,
emotional scene like that?

207
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,766
I'm so relieved you understand.

208
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,821
I invited them over
for dinner tonight.

209
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,518
- What?
- I had to.

210
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:06,175
This would have gone on forever.
You're an avoider.

211
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:10,005
- I'm calling them and canceling.
- No, you're not.

212
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,496
You're telling your family
you adopted a baby tonight.

213
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:15,971
And you do have avoidance issues.
Even Longinus said so.

214
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,533
Are you really
not hearing these names?

215
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:24,476
Don't answer it!
I'll get it!

216
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,389
Hi. Hey. You must be Dylan.

217
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:36,405
I'm Haley's mother.

218
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,611
Come on. Let's go.

219
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:41,248
Hang on one second.

220
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:45,568
You're still in high school?

221
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,020
- Yeah, I'm a senior.
- A senior. Cool.

222
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,814
Phil? Sweetie? Honey?

223
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,780
He is Dylan, and he is a senior.

224
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,402
And you need to scare him.

225
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,622
Lemme meet this playa.

226
00:10:58,872 --> 00:11:00,172
Phil Dunphy, yo.

227
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:09,222
It's like that. You just stare down
on them. Let the eyes do the work.

228
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:13,254
Your mouth might be saying, "We cool,"
but your eyes are like, "No, we not."

229
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,123
"Nice to meet you."

230
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,498
"No, it's not."

231
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:18,806
"S'all good."

232
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,779
"S'no, it s'nisn't."

233
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:26,684
- Okay, I see you two guys...
- Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,977
You two...

235
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,780
You two keep it real.
Know what I mean, son?

236
00:11:34,164 --> 00:11:35,214
Not really.

237
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:37,878
- Please stop.
- That's cool.

238
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,093
Oh, God! That's my back!

239
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,968
- Sweetheart...
- I slipped in the baby oil!

240
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:46,116
"Where are you from originally?"

241
00:11:46,474 --> 00:11:49,874
"I could defeat you if it came
to a physical confrontation."

242
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,479
I don't know about this...
Should I call a doctor?

243
00:11:55,701 --> 00:11:57,452
You're very strong, homes.

244
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,926
Okay, nice.
Nice soft landing.

245
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:03,393
- Okay, let's go.
- I am on my side, though.

246
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:07,063
So just flip me right back,
and we're good. We'll be good.

247
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:11,405
I need to get flipped right on my back,
and we should be fine, so...

248
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:17,739
Brenda Feldman.

249
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,132
What is that?

250
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:22,577
- A poem written for Brenda Feldman.
- Of course it is.

251
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:26,281
I put my thoughts into words,
and now my words into action!

252
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,098
I'll give you 50 bucks
not to do this.

253
00:12:29,223 --> 00:12:31,733
I'm 11 years old.
What am I gonna do with money?

254
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:33,922
What are you gonna do
with a 16-year-old?

255
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,288
He's like a bullfighter.

256
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,594
Ever see a bullfight?
I can't watch this.

257
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,785
You're in such a bad mood.
And I know why.

258
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,201
It's because that man
thought you were my father.

259
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:50,060
When you say "no" like that,
it's always "yes."

260
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:53,371
Come on, we're in the mall.
Let's get you some younger clothes.

261
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:56,491
- There's a store there that I know...
- I don't need any "younger clothes."

262
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:59,952
And I don't care what some jackass in
a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me.

263
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,741
Good. You shouldn't.

264
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,942
You should only care what I think.

265
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,677
I love you, and I don't care
how old you are.

266
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:10,370
So stop being a gloomy goose,
and stop being so hard on Manny.

267
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:14,455
I'm hard on Manny just because I don't
want to see him make a fool of himself.

268
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,716
And I can smell
that hair goo of his from here.

269
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,765
Look, I don't know what's gonna
happen to him over there,

270
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,606
but you're his family now,
and that means only one thing.

271
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,981
You be the wind in his back,
not the spit in his face.

272
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:30,235
What?

273
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,820
Something mom always says.
It's gorgeous in Spanish.

274
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,969
He's there.

275
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:41,728
She has a boyfriend.

276
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,285
<i>I am sorry, mi niño!</i>

277
00:13:44,648 --> 00:13:46,177
I gave her my heart,

278
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:49,602
and she gave me a picture of me
as an old-time sheriff.

279
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:53,709
That was pretty stupid of me,
wasn't it?

280
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,839
<i>No, mi amor. It was brave.
Right, Jay? Brave.</i>

281
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,050
Well, you'll know better next time.

282
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:02,219
Come on, let's get a pretzel.

283
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:13,356
Excuse me, sir. We ask
that all mall walkers stay to the right.

284
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:29,191
Alex! Get out!

285
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,083
- Mom!
- Alex, leave your sister alone!

286
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,043
I was just getting my book. Gosh.

287
00:14:34,168 --> 00:14:37,468
I know, sweetie, but you need
to respect their privacy.

288
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,448
What are they doing up there?

289
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:42,423
Nothing. Lying in her bed,
watching a movie.

290
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,458
I'm making a cake for tonight.

291
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,360
You want to help me
with the frosting?

292
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:51,285
Sure.

293
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,389
So, you know, if Haley got pregnant,

294
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:57,670
would you ever pretend
she has mono for a few months

295
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,241
and then,
tell everyone the baby's yours?

296
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,166
What?

297
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,031
This senior at school was
out sick for like four months,

298
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:08,156
but Jenna Resnick swears she saw her
breast-feeding at a coin-op car wash.

299
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,501
Buddy, what are you wearing?

300
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,730
Nothing.

301
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,505
No jacket. One hat.

302
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:22,300
How many pairs of underwear
do you have on?

303
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,466
One.

304
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:25,488
Six.

305
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:29,002
First of all, it would be really
cool to see Haley that fat,

306
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:32,768
and how awesome would it be to have
a fake brother who's really my nephew?

307
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,563
Haley is not getting pregnant.

308
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:37,558
I'm just saying "if."

309
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:41,433
You like making trouble for your sister,
but it's not gonna work this time.

310
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:44,310
You know why?
'Cause your sister's a good girl.

311
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:47,035
I know. I was just like her
when I was...

312
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:51,162
I want you to know,
I'm not enjoying this,

313
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,664
but this is an important lesson
that you're learning.

314
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,690
Soak it. Keep it...

315
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:00,963
You're too close.
It's gonna hurt.

316
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,731
It's supposed to hurt.

317
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,407
And why are you smiling?

318
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:06,001
I'm... what?

319
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,367
Oh, forget it.

320
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:21,029
I can't do this.

321
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:23,986
The point is, you're scared.
I think you've learned your lesson...

322
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,285
Mom?!

323
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:29,479
What are you doing?

324
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:33,254
I was just, um, dropping off
some laundry. Is this a bad time?

325
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,084
Can you shut the door, please?

326
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,670
Actually,
we're just gonna leave that open.

327
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:42,638
Why?

328
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:46,148
Because I have seen
this little show before...

329
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,573
Lying on the bed with a tall senior.

330
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,902
One minute, you're friends watching
"Falcon Crest,"

331
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,641
the next, you're lying underneath
the table, your bra in your pocket.

332
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,142
Mom!

333
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,062
- You hit my bone!
- It was an accident!

334
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,330
- I thought you were my friend!
- I am your friend!

335
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:05,475
Dad? You have got to talk to mom!
She is, like, completely freaking out

336
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,788
and embarrassing me!

337
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:09,198
Honey, your mom isn't
always as cool about things...

338
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,720
What is with this thing?!

339
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,301
My dad still isn't
completely comfortable with...

340
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:20,858
This.

341
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,424
It's been five years now,
and he still does this thing

342
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,990
where he announces himself
before walking into any room we're in,

343
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,365
just to make sure he doesn't
have to ever see us kiss.

344
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:33,855
Wish my mother had that system.

345
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,630
- Remember?
- Not now.

346
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,365
I still can't believe
you did this to me.

347
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,603
Would you get in the spirit
of things?

348
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,178
It's a celebration.

349
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:46,476
Oh, God.

350
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,467
I'm gonna go get Lily ready...

351
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,972
and I want you to just
come straight out with it.

352
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,980
You can do this.

353
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,163
Sports-guy chest bump.

354
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:58,171
Do it. Go.

355
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:08,761
How are you?

356
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,189
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, here you go.

357
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:13,404
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank us. Open it.

358
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:15,379
Dad is coming right behind.

359
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,337
We're here! Coming in!

360
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,417
Don't worry, Dad.
Nothing gay going on here.

361
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,087
May I take your multicolored
coat and bejeweled cap?

362
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:35,412
- What a beautiful dress.
- Ay, thank you, "Feel."

363
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,354
That's how she says "Phil."
Not "Feel", "Phil."

364
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,161
- So, how was your trip?
- It was good, actually.

365
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:45,486
About that,

366
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:48,437
I have something
that I need to tell you guys.

367
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,826
We didn't just go to Vietnam
for pleasure.

368
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:52,951
We kind of have some big news.

369
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,994
Oh, God. If Cam comes out here
with boobs, I'm leaving.

370
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:59,081
I hope he didn't embarrass you, Mom.

371
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:02,193
Don't mind her. Haley had
her first boy over today, and...

372
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:03,518
Phil shot him.

373
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:08,127
Anyway, so, about a year ago,

374
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:10,204
Cam and I were sort of
feeling this longing,

375
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,011
for something more,
like a... maybe a baby.

376
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,346
That's a bad idea.

377
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:17,493
- What do you mean, "bad idea"?
- Kids need a mother.

378
00:19:17,618 --> 00:19:21,127
- If you two guys are bored, get a dog.
- We're not bored, Dad.

379
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,934
I support you, Mitchell,
even though you're not my son.

380
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,026
What dad is trying to say is that,
Mitchell, you're a little uptight,

381
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:31,113
kids bring chaos,
and you don't handle it well.

382
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,798
That's not what dad's saying.
That's what you're saying.

383
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,989
And it's insulting
in a whole different way.

384
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,316
People, let's all chillax.

385
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,894
Where's Uncle Cameron?

386
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:44,251
Someone who's not insulting me
notices he's not here.

387
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,172
So that's the big announcement, huh?
You two broke up.

388
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:50,914
Well, a baby wasn't
gonna help that, anyway.

389
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,094
Let me tell you, you're better off,
because he was a bit of a drama queen.

390
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:55,478
Stop, stop.

391
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:59,039
You come into my house
and you insult me and my boyfriend,

392
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:02,518
who, by the way,
is not that dramatic, and... Oh, God.

393
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,164
We adopted a baby.

394
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,244
Her name is Lily.

395
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,669
Exciting!

396
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,409
Just turn it off.

397
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:26,662
I can't turn it off. It's who I am.

398
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,629
- The music!
- Yes, the music.

399
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:30,399
Come say hi to Lily!

400
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:33,214
A little princess!
She is a little princess!

401
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:36,303
She is so cute!

402
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:38,181
Let me see her.
Let me see her.

403
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:44,520
"Lily," isn't that gonna be
hard for her to say?

404
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Excuse me.

405
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,164
I know that I said
I thought this was a bad idea.

406
00:20:51,155 --> 00:20:51,955
But...

407
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:54,734
What do I know?

408
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,515
I mean, it's not like
I wrote the book on fatherhood.

409
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,085
Been trying all my life to get it right.
I'm still screwing up.

410
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,122
- Right, Manny?
- I wrote a song about it in the car.

411
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:05,932
Of course you did.

412
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,235
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

413
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,463
And you should know that...

414
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,451
I'm not here to spit in your face.

415
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,933
I'm here to... blow at your back.

416
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,388
- I don't understand.
- I don't...

417
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,896
It's supposed to
sound better in Spanish.

418
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:30,524
That's beautiful. And thank you.

419
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,739
Anyhow, Mitch...

420
00:21:35,266 --> 00:21:36,458
No, Dad, it's...

421
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:38,377
I got her.

422
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:41,086
- She wants her grandpa!
- She wants her daddy!

423
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:43,303
- Do you want to meet grandpa?
- Are you kidding?

424
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,728
She's one of us now.
Let me see the little pot sticker.

425
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:49,833
You're a cutie, aren't you?

426
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,084
Look at this.

427
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:56,133
<i>"We're from different worlds,</i>

428
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,318
<i>"Yet we somehow fit together.</i>

429
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,739
<i>"Love is what binds us,</i>

430
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,966
<i>"Through fair or stormy weather.</i>

431
00:22:04,578 --> 00:22:06,977
<i>"I stand before you now
with only one agenda...</i>

432
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,655
"To let you know my heart is yours,
Feldman comma Brenda."

433
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:15,210
I mean, seriously!

434
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,031
Luke, so far,
hasn't beaten me in basketball.

435
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,149
It's 2-0.

436
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:23,423
2-0.

437
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,831
- Get that weak stuff out of my kitchen!
- Dad, stop it!

438
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,225
Can you do me a favor and just...

439
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,150
- This is dumb.
- How's the weather down there?

440
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,467
But when the day comes
that he does win...

441
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,999
if/when he beats me,

442
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,302
I'm just gonna be like,
"Well done. Well done."

443
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,471
<i>Just, like, let him...
Just support him in that kind of stuff.</i>

444
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,686
I'd probably want to just go 2 out of 3
and just see what happens there, but...
